# Known issues

### TRADING SIMULATOR
- User first needs to kind of save settings...
- When going to GRID from DCA, DCA panel is still visible and doesnt hide so it overwrites GRID settings...
- Trading results do not reset when going from DCA to GRID and vice versa, so user needs to restart the whole application

### CODE GENERATOR
- Staking function is not programmed correctly, it now sets the staked balance to 0 even tho user doesnt not withdraw all his staked tokens.
